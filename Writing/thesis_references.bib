  abstract = {In the pursuit of the measurement of the still-elusive ultrahigh-energy (UHE) neutrino flux at energies of order EeV, detectors using the in-ice Askaryan radio technique have increasingly targeted lower trigger thresholds. This has led to improved trigger-level sensitivity to UHE neutrinos. Working with data collected by the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA), we search for neutrino candidates at the lowest threshold achieved to date, leading to improved analysis-level sensitivities. A neutrino search on a data set with 208.7\textasciitilde days of livetime from the reduced-threshold fifth ARA station is performed, achieving a 68\textbackslash\% analysis efficiency over all energies on a simulated mixed-composition neutrino flux with an expected background of \$0.10\_\{-0.04\}\textasciicircum\{+0.06\}\$ events passing the analysis. We observe one event passing our analysis and proceed to set a neutrino flux limit using a Feldman-Cousins construction. We show that the improved trigger-level sensitivity can be carried through an analysis, motivating the Phased Array triggering technique for use in future radio-detection experiments. We also include a projection using all available data from this detector. Finally, we find that future analyses will benefit from studies of events near the surface to fully understand the background expected for a large-scale detector.},

  abstract = {We present a semi-analytical method for the calculation of coherent Askaryan radiation in showers induced by neutrinos of any flavor in ice. We compare our results with those of a full Monte Carlo simulation based on the ZHAireS code. This approach is able to reproduce the vector potential and hence electric field at any experimentally relevant observer position in the time domain. This work extends published results only valid for electron-induced showers. We establish the validity of the semi-analytical calculation of the radio signal produced by all types of neutrino-induced showers in ice. The method is computationally efficient and only requires as inputs the longitudinal charge excess profile of the showers and a parameterization of the vector potential in the far-field region of the shower at the Cherenkov angle that we also provide. Our methodology avoids tracking the contributions to the electric field from millions of particles every time the radio pulse has to be calculated at a given observer position. These results can be readily used in the interpretation of the data taken by experiments, and in the planning and design of future initiatives based on the radio technique in ice.},

  abstract = {We present the results of the first transient survey from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA) using 31 hr of data, in which we place the most constraining limits on the instantaneous transient surface density at timescales of 13 s to a few minutes and at frequencies below 100 MHz. The OVRO-LWA is a dipole array that images the entire viewable hemisphere with 58 MHz of bandwidth from 27 to 84 MHz at 13 s cadence. No transients are detected above a 6.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$ flux density limit of 10.5 Jy, implying an upper limit to the transient surface density of \$2.5\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum\{-8\}\$ deg\$\textasciicircum\{-2\}\$ at the shortest timescales probed, which is orders of magnitude deeper than has been achieved at sub-100 MHz frequencies and comparable flux densities to date. The nondetection of transients in the OVRO-LWA survey, particularly at minutes-long timescales, allows us to place further constraints on the rate of the potential population of transients uncovered by Stewart et al. (2016). From their transient rate, we expect a detection of \$8.4\textasciicircum\{+31.8\}\_\{-8.0\}\$ events, and the probability of our null detection is \$1.9\textasciicircum\{+644\}\_\{-1.9\}\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum\{-3\}\$, ruling out a transient rate \${$>$}1.4\textbackslash times10\textasciicircum\{-4\} \textbackslash text\{days\}\textasciicircum\{-1\} \textbackslash text\{deg\}\textasciicircum\{-2\}\$ with 95\% confidence at a flux density limit of 18.1 Jy, under the assumption of a flat spectrum and wide bandwidth. We discuss the implications of our nondetection for this population and further constraints that can be made on the source spectral index, intrinsic emission bandwidth, and resulting luminosity distribution.},

  abstract = {Radio astronomy observational facilities are under constant upgradation and development to achieve better capabilities including increasing the time and frequency resolutions of the recorded data, and increasing the receiving and recording bandwidth. As only a limited spectrum resource has been allocated to radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union, this results in the radio observational instrumentation being inevitably exposed to undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI) signals which originate mainly from terrestrial human activity and are becoming stronger with time. RFIs degrade the quality of astronomical data and even lead to data loss. The impact of RFIs on scientific outcome is becoming progressively difficult to manage. In this article, we motivate the requirement for RFI mitigation, and review the RFI characteristics, mitigation techniques and strategies. Mitigation strategies adopted at some representative observatories, telescopes and arrays are also introduced. We also discuss and present advantages and shortcomings of the four classes of RFI mitigation strategies, applicable at the connected causal stages: preventive, pre-detection, pre-correlation and post-correlation. The proper identification and flagging of RFI is key to the reduction of data loss and improvement in data quality, and is also the ultimate goal of developing RFI mitigation techniques. This can be achieved through a strategy involving a combination of the discussed techniques in stages. Recent advances in high speed digital signal processing and high performance computing allow for performing RFI excision of large data volumes generated from large telescopes or arrays in both real time and offline modes, aiding the proposed strategy.},

  abstract = {LOPES, the LOFAR prototype station, was an antenna array for cosmic-ray air showers operating from 2003 - 2013 within the KASCADE-Grande experiment. Meanwhile, the analysis is finished and the data of air-shower events measured by LOPES are available with open access in the KASCADE Cosmic Ray Data Center (KCDC). This article intends to provide a summary of the achievements, results, and lessons learned from LOPES. By digital, interferometric beamforming the detection of air showers became possible in the radio-loud environment of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). As a prototype experiment, LOPES tested several antenna types, array configurations and calibration techniques, and pioneered analysis methods for the reconstruction of the most important shower parameters, i.e., the arrival direction, the energy, and mass-dependent observables such as the position of the shower maximum. In addition to a review and update of previously published results, we also present new results based on end-to-end simulations including all known instrumental properties. For this, we applied the detector response to radio signals simulated with the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, and analyzed them in the same way as measured data. Thus, we were able to study the detector performance more accurately than before, including some previously inaccessible features such as the impact of noise on the interferometric cross-correlation beam. These results led to several improvements, which are documented in this paper and can provide useful input for the design of future cosmic-ray experiments based on the digital radio-detection technique.},

  abstract = {Radio-based detection of high-energy particles is growing in maturity. In this chapter, we focus on the detection of neutrinos with energies in excess of 10 PeV that interact in the thick, radio-transparent ice found in the polar regions. High-energy neutrinos interacting in the ice generate short duration, radio-frequency flashes through the Askaryan effect that can be measured with antennas installed at shallow depths. The abundant target material and the long attenuation lengths of around 1 km allow cost-effective instrumentation of huge volumes with a sparse array of radio detector stations. This detector architecture provides sufficient sensitivity to the low flux of ultra-high-energy neutrinos to probe the production of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays whose origin is one of the longest-standing riddles in astroparticle physics. We describe the signal characteristics, propagation effects, detector setup, suitable detection sites, and background processes. We give an overview of the current experimental landscape and an outlook into the future where almost the entire sky can be viewed by a judicious choice of detector locations.},

On the basis of this equation we obtained the radar equation relating the scattered signal spectrum to the spatial spectrum of fluctuations. Also, a statistical radar equation is obtained that relates the mean statistical power of the scattered signal to the spectral density of the dielectric permittivity fluctuations without a classical approximation of the smallness of the irregularities' spatial correlation radius. The work deals with the bistatic sounding case, when the exact forward scattering and exact backward scattering are absent and sounding signal has sufficiently narrow spectral band for scattered volume to change slowly on ranges of Fresnel radius order. The statistical radar equations obtained differ from the classical ones in the presence of coherent structures with big correlation radii, and so the received signal spectrum can differ from the intrinsic spectrum of irregularities.},

  abstract = {Radio refraction in the lower atmosphere often makes it possible for radar receivers to see round the curved surface of the earth and to plot targets far below the geometrical horizon. This phenomenon of super-refraction is associated with the occurrence of a radio duct, or wave guide, close to the surface of the earth. Any two points within such a duct are intervisible by refraction even though each is below the other's geometrical horizon. Field strength at one due to a transmitter at the other can therefore be of the same order of magnitude as would occur in complete free space, provided that the wavelength is sufficiently short and atmospheric attenuation is unimportant. With increase of wavelength, however, the duct (being qualitatively similar to a wave guide in the form of a metallic pipe) ceases to be able to guide the waves efficiently: for sufficiently long wavelengths propagation takes place substantially as though no duct existed. Dekametre and longer wavelengths are largely free from superrefraction because ducts sufficiently large to guide these wavelengths efficiently do not occur in the atmosphere. Centimetre waves are prone to super-refraction because ducts extending from the earth's surface up to a height of the order of 100 ft are sufficient to guide them quite efficiently and are of frequent occurrence. In its most intense form (ducts extending from the surface up to heights of a few thousand feet) efficient guiding is possible, not merely for centimetre wavelengths, but also for decimetre and metre wavelengths. In its weak form, super-refraction merely causes a decrease in attenuation beyond the horizon, particularly at centimetre wavelengths.},

The goal is to explore the commonality of different approaches to help researchers in both fields interpret each other's concepts and jargon. The paper elaborates on the astronomers' concept of gain closure relations and how they may be used in a “self‐calibrating” system of RFI cancellation. Further discussion of the eigen‐decomposition method in terms of RFI power and antenna gains introduces adaptive nulling and RFI cancellation through matrix partitioning. While multipath scattering appears at first glance to be fatal to methods of RFI cancellation, its effect is easily incorporated in frequency‐dependent gain coefficients under many circumstances.},

  abstract = {Cosmic rays are the highest energy particles found in nature. Measurements of the mass composition of cosmic rays between 10\textasciicircum\{17\} eV and 10\textasciicircum\{18\} eV are essential to understand whether this energy range is dominated by Galactic or extragalactic sources. It has also been proposed that the astrophysical neutrino signal comes from accelerators capable of producing cosmic rays of these energies. Cosmic rays initiate cascades of secondary particles (air showers) in the atmosphere and their masses are inferred from measurements of the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum, Xmax, or the composition of shower particles reaching the ground. Current measurements suffer from either low precision, or a low duty cycle and a high energy threshold. Radio detection of cosmic rays is a rapidly developing technique, suitable for determination of Xmax with a duty cycle of in principle nearly 100\%. The radiation is generated by the separation of relativistic charged particles in the geomagnetic field and a negative charge excess in the shower front. Here we report radio measurements of Xmax with a mean precision of 16 g/cm\textasciicircum 2 between 10\textasciicircum\{17\}-10\textasciicircum\{17.5\} eV. Because of the high resolution in \$Xmax we can determine the mass spectrum and find a mixed composition, containing a light mass fraction of \textasciitilde 80\%. Unless the extragalactic component becomes significant already below 10\textasciicircum\{17.5\} eV, our measurements indicate an additional Galactic component dominating at this energy range.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in understanding the initiation and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is measuring the magnetic field of the magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) that drive CMEs. Recent developments in radio imaging spectroscopy have paved the way for diagnosing the CMEs’ magnetic field using gyrosynchrotron radiation. We present magnetic field measurements of a CME associated with an X5class flare by combining radio imaging spectroscopy data in microwaves (1–18 GHz) and meter-wave (20–88 MHz), obtained by the Owens Valley Radio Observatory’s Expanded Owens Valley Solar Array (EOVSA) and Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), respectively. EOVSA observations reveal that the microwave source, observed in the low corona during the initiation phase of the eruption, outlines the bottom of the rising MFR-hosting CME bubble seen in extreme ultraviolet and expands as the bubble evolves. As the MFR erupts into the middle corona and appears as a white light CME, its meter-wave counterpart, observed by OVRO-LWA, displays a similar morphology. For the first time, using gyrosynchrotron spectral diagnostics, we obtain magnetic field measurements of the erupting MFR in both the low and middle corona, corresponding to coronal heights of 0.02 and 1.83 R⊙. The magnetic field strength is found to be around 300 G at 0.02 R⊙ during the CME initiation, and about 0.6 G near the leading edge of the CME when it propagates to 1.83 R⊙. These results provide critical new insights into the magnetic structure of the CME and its evolution during the early stages of its eruption.},

  abstract = {This article presents the GCM‐Oriented Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud Product (GOCCP) designed to evaluate the cloudiness simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). For this purpose, Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization L1 data are processed following the same steps as in a lidar simulator used to diagnose the model cloud cover that CALIPSO would observe from space if the satellite was flying above an atmosphere similar to that predicted by the GCM. Instantaneous profiles of the lidar scattering ratio (SR) are first computed at the highest horizontal resolution of the data but at the vertical resolution typical of current GCMs, and then cloud diagnostics are inferred from these profiles: vertical distribution of cloud fraction, horizontal distribution of low, middle, high, and total cloud fractions, instantaneous SR profiles, and SR histograms as a function of height. Results are presented for different seasons (January–March 2007–2008 and June–August 2006–2008), and their sensitivity to parameters of the lidar simulator is investigated. It is shown that the choice of the vertical resolution and of the SR threshold value used for cloud detection can modify the cloud fraction by up to 0.20, particularly in the shallow cumulus regions. The tropical marine low‐level cloud fraction is larger during nighttime (by up to 0.15) than during daytime. The histograms of SR characterize the cloud types encountered in different regions. The GOCCP high‐level cloud amount is similar to that from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The low‐level and middle‐level cloud fractions are larger than those derived from passive remote sensing (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, Moderate‐Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer–Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy System Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances, TOVS Path B, AIRS–Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) because the latter only provide information on the uppermost cloud layer.},

  abstract = {The dispersion and absorption of a considerable number of liquid and dielectrics are represented by the empirical formula ε*−ε∞=(ε0−ε∞)/[1+(iωτ0)1−α]. In this equation, ε* is the complex dielectric constant, ε0 and ε∞ are the ``static'' and ``infinite frequency'' dielectric constants, ω=2π times the frequency, and τ0 is a generalized relaxation time. The parameter α can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. The expression (1) requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below this axis.             If a distribution of relaxation times is assumed to account for Eq. (1), it is possible to calculate the necessary distribution function by the method of Fuoss and Kirkwood. It is, however, difficult to understand the physical significance of this formal result.             If a dielectric satisfying Eq. (1) is represented by a three-element electrical circuit, the mechanism responsible for the dispersion is equivalent to a complex impedance with a phase angle which is independent of the frequency. On this basis, the mechanism of interaction has the striking property that energy is conserved or ``stored'' in addition to being dissipated and that the ratio of the average energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle is independent of the frequency.},

  abstract = {The 1974 discovery, by Russell A. Hulse and Joseph H. Taylor, of the first binary pulsar PSR B1913+16, opened up new possibilities for the study of relativistic gravity. PSR B1913+16, as well as several other binary pulsars, provided direct observational proofs that gravity propagates at the velocity of light and has a quadrupolar structure. Binary pulsars also provided accurate tests of the strong-field regime of relativistic gravity. General Relativity has passed all the binary pulsar tests with flying colors. The discovery of binary pulsars had also very important consequences for astrophysics: accurate measurement of neutron star masses, improved understanding of the possible evolution scenarios for the coevolution of binary stars, proof of the existence of binary neutron stars emitting gravitational waves for hundreds of millions of years, before coalescing in catastrophic events radiating intense gravitational-wave signals, and probably leading also to important emissions of electromagnetic radiation and neutrinos. This article reviews the history of the discovery of the first binary pulsar, and describes both its immediate impact, and its longer-term effect on theoretical and experimental studies of relativistic gravity.},

  abstract = {The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) is an in-ice ultra high energy (UHE, \${$>$}10\$ PeV) neutrino experiment at the South Pole that aims to detect UHE neutrino-induced radio emission in ice. ARA consists of five independent stations each consisting of a cubical lattice of in-ice antenna clusters with a side length of \$\textbackslash sim\$10 m buried at \$\textbackslash sim\$200 m below the ice surface. The fifth station of ARA (A5) is special as this station has an additional central string, the phased array (PA), which provides an interferometric trigger that enables ARA to trigger on weak signals that are otherwise buried in noise. Leveraging the low threshold phased array trigger, ARA was the first radio neutrino experiment to demonstrate significant improvement in sensitivity to weak signals. In this contribution, we present initial results from a neutrino search combining information from both the traditional station antennas and the phased array antennas of the A5 station. We show the improved vertex reconstruction achieved with this approach, and leveraging this improvement, we expect to enhance the analysis efficiency beyond what has been achieved previously by ARA. This analysis is the paradigmatic representation of future neutrino searches with the next generation of in-ice neutrino experiments.},

The third flight of ANITA, lasting 22 days, began in December 2014. We develop a methodology to search for energetic neutrinos spatially and temporally coincident with potential source classes in ANITA data. This methodology is applied to several source classes: the potential IceCube-identified neutrino sources TXS 0506+056and NGC 1068, flaring high-energy blazars reported by the Fermi All-Sky Variability Analysis, gamma-ray bursts, and supernovae. Among searches within the five source classes, one candidate was identified as associated with SN 2015D, although not at a statistically significant level. We proceed to place upper limits on the source classes. We further comment on potential application of this methodology to more sensitive future instruments.},

Despite some studies led until the early nineties, the [1-10] MHz band has remained unused for 20 years. However, it has been measured by some pioneering experiments that extensive air shower emit a strong electric field in this band and that there is evidence of a large increase in the amplitude of the radio pulse at lower frequencies. The EXTASIS experiment, located within the Nançay Radioastronomy Observatory and supported by the CODALEMA experiment, aims to reinvestigate the [1-10] MHz band, and especially to study the so-called "Sudden Death" contribution, the expected electric field emitted by shower front when hitting the ground level. Currently, EXTASIS has confirmed some results obtained by the pioneering experiments, and tends to bring explanations to the other ones, for instance the role of the underlying atmospheric electric field. Moreover, CODALEMA has demonstrated that in the most commonly used frequency band ([20-80] MHz) the electric field profile of EAS can be well sampled, and contains all the information needed for the reconstruction of EAS: an automatic comparison between the SELFAS3 simulations and data has been developed, allowing us to reconstruct in an almost real time the primary cosmic ray characteristics.},

  abstract = {Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) hit the Earth's atmosphere with energies exceeding \$10\textasciicircum\{18\}\$ eV. This is the same energy as carried by a tennis ball moving at 100 km/h, but concentrated on a sub-atomic particle. UHECRs are so rare (the flux of particles with \$E {$>$} 10\textasciicircum\{20\}\$ eV is 0.5/km\$\textasciicircum 2\$/century) that only a few such particles have been detected over the past 50 years. Recently, the HiRes and Auger experiments have reported the discovery of a high-energy cut-off in the UHECR spectrum, and Auger has found an apparent clustering of the highest energy events towards nearby active galactic nuclei. Consensus is building that the highest energy particles are accelerated within the radio-bright lobes of these objects, but it remains unclear how this actually happens, and whether the cut-off is due to propagation effects or reflects an intrinsically physical limitation of the acceleration process. The low event statistics presently allows for many different plausible models; nevertheless observations are beginning to impose strong constraints on them. These observations have also motivated suggestions that new physics may be implicated. We present a review of the key theoretical and observational issues related to the processes of propagation and acceleration of UHECRs and proposed solutions.},

This method exploits the radio emission generated in the electromagnetic component of a particle shower following a neutrino interaction. NuRadioMC simulates everything from the neutrino interaction in a medium, the subsequent Askaryan radio emission, the propagation of the radio signal to the detector and finally the detector response. NuRadioMC is designed as a modern, modular Python-based framework, combining flexibility in detector design with user-friendliness. It includes a state-of-the-art event generator, an improved modelling of the radio emission, a revisited approach to signal propagation and increased flexibility and precision in the detector simulation. This paper focuses on the implemented physics processes and their implications for detector design. A variety of models and parameterizations for the radio emission of neutrino-induced showers are compared and reviewed. Comprehensive examples are used to discuss the capabilities of the code and different aspects of instrumental design decisions.},

EVA will improve over ANITA’s integrated totals – the current state-of-the-art in UHE suborbital payloads – by 1–2 orders of magnitude in a single flight. The design is based on a novel application of toroidal reflector optics which utilizes a super-pressure balloon surface, along with a feed-array mounted on an inner membrane, to create an ultra-large radio antenna system with a synoptic view of the Antarctic ice sheet below it. Radio impulses arise via the Askaryan effect when UHE neutrinos interact within the ice, or via geosynchrotron emission when UHE cosmic rays interact in the atmosphere above the continent. EVA’s instantaneous antenna aperture is estimated to be several hundred m2 for detection of these events within a 150–600 MHz band. For standard cosmogenic UHE neutrino models, EVA should detect of order 30 events per flight in the EeV energy regime. For UHE cosmic rays, of order 15,000 geosynchrotron events would be detected in total, several hundred above 10 EeV, and of order 60 above the GZK cutoff energy.},

Charge-exchange associated with thunderclouds leads to positive charge in the upper conductive regions of the atmosphere and a net negative charge on the planetary surface. In non-thunderstorm regions, a vertical ionic current flows, replenishing the air with molecular ions otherwise removed by attachment, recombination or nucleation processes. Ions may have indirect effects on non-thunderstorm clouds, and therefore conceivably on climate, via cloud microphysical processes. Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) and Ice Nuclei (IN) are necessary for the formation of water clouds and freezing of ice clouds respectively. In both cases, ionisation may be important: it is now known that ultrafine aerosol can be formed from ionisation, probably providing an additional source of CCN. It is also known that electrified aerosol, perhaps active as IN, can be collected by droplets more effectively than neutral particles.},

  abstract = {Evidence is emerging for physical links among clouds, global temperatures, the global atmospheric electrical circuit and cosmic ray ionisation. The global circuit extends throughout the atmosphere from the planetary surface to the lower layers of the ionosphere. Cosmic rays are the principal source of atmospheric ions away from the continental boundary layer: the ions formed permit a vertical conduction current to flow in the fair weather part of the global circuit. Through the (inverse) solar modulation of cosmic rays, the resulting columnar ionisation changes may allow the global circuit to convey a solar influence to meteorological phenomena of the lower atmosphere. Electrical effects on nonthunderstorm clouds have been proposed to occur via the ion-assisted formation of ultrafine aerosol, which can grow to sizes able to act as cloud condensation nuclei, or through the increased ice nucleation capability of charged aerosols. Even small atmospheric electrical modulations on the aerosol size distribution can affect cloud properties and modify the radiative balance of the atmosphere, through changes communicated globally by the atmospheric electrical circuit. Despite a long history of work in related areas of geophysics, the direct and inverse relationships between the global circuit and global climate remain largely quantitatively unexplored. From reviewing atmospheric electrical measurements made over two centuries and possible paleoclimate proxies, global atmospheric electrical circuit variability should be expected on many timescales.},

  abstract = {Natural terrestrial radioactivity and cosmic ray ionization lead to the formation of air ions and charged aerosol particles even away from regions of active charge separation, such as in thunderstorms. The natural electrified state of the atmosphere has been studied for over a century; however, the effect of ionization on the physical properties of aerosols and clouds has rarely been studied in its own right except in thunderstorms. Here we review the status of our understanding of atmospheric charged particles and their influence on aerosol and cloud microphysical processes. We also review mechanisms that have been recently proposed to connect variations in the atmospheric ionization rate with variations in global cloudiness and weather systems. We conclude that a mechanism linking cosmic ray ionization and cloud properties cannot be excluded and that there are established electrical effects on aerosol and cloud microphysics. Necessary further work includes measurements of cloud, droplet, and aerosol charging and ion‐aerosol conversion, together with modeling of the electrical aspects of nonthunderstorm cloud microphysics.},

The numerous results discussed can be used for solutions to both inverse and direct problems of cloud optics. An introduction to main microphysical characteristics of water and ice clouds, including the effective size, the liquid water content and path, the concentration of particles, is given. The refractive index of water and ice, which is of importance for optical waves propagation in clouds, is also considered. We consider extinction and absorption coefficients, phase functions, and asymmetry parameters of water and ice clouds and their relationships with the size, shape, and concentration of water droplets and ice crystals. Simple analytical results for absorption, reflection, and transmission characteristics of cloudy media are given. They are valid for optically thick clouds with optical thickness larger than 5. We have reviewed studies of polarization of solar light reflected from clouds. Image transfer problems have been considered as well. Modern methods of passive remote sensing of water and ice clouds are discussed. The review is finished by the discussion of optical properties of inhomogeneous clouds, which is a main topic of modern cloud optics research.},

  abstract = {Digital radio detection of cosmic-ray air showers has emerged as an alternative technique in high-energy astroparticle physics. Estimation of the detection efficiency of cosmic-ray radio arrays is one of the few remaining challenges regarding this technique. To address this problem, we developed a model based on the explicit probabilistic treatment of key elements of the radio technique for air showers: the footprint of the radio signal on ground, the detection of the signal in an individual antenna, and the detection criterion on the level of the entire array. The model allows for estimation of sky regions of full efficiency and can be used to compute the aperture of the array, which is essential to measure the absolute flux of cosmic rays. We also present a semi-analytical method that we apply to the generic model, to calculate the efficiency and aperture with high accuracy and reasonable calculation time. The model in this paper is applied to the Tunka-Rex array as example instrument and validated against Monte Carlo simulations. The validation shows that the model performs well, in particular, in the prediction of regions with full efficiency. It can thus be applied to other antenna arrays to facilitate the measurement of absolute cosmic-ray fluxes and to minimize a selection bias in cosmic-ray studies.},

  abstract = {For over a century, raindrop size distributions have been a subject of extensive scientific study, typically described by models including the Marshall–Palmer exponential equation, gamma, Weibull, lognormal and other mathematical functions. In this work, we present a theory that integrates deterministic principles from thermodynamics and fluid dynamics with stochastic elements to predict expected raindrop diameters and describe ground-level drop-size distributions. Importantly, our approach avoids assuming specific drop-size dispersion processes or relying on multi-variable empirical data fitting. We derive analytical equations for key raindrop parameters (e.g., median diameter, expected minimum and maximum diameters) and drop-size distributions as functions of rainfall intensity. Our theoretical predictions align well with extensive published experimental data, covering rainfall intensities from 0.4 to 40 mm/h across diverse global locations. Additionally, consistent with observations of super-large raindrops, our theory suggests a maximum ground-level raindrop diameter limit of around 10 mm. We establish analytical expressions for meteorological parameters like the Marshall-Palmer constant and total raindrop concentration, validated against empirical data. The theoretical approach presented here can find broad applications in climate modeling, sprays and aerosol dynamics, bubbles and particles, extraterrestrial rainfall, and paleoclimatology.},

This RF-only capability is predicated on novel techniques for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) identification and mitigation with an analysis efficiency of approximately 45\% for showerdriven events with a Signal-to-noise ratio ≳ 5 against the galactic background noise power of individual antennas. Radio self-triggering enables more efficient detection of cosmic rays over a wider range of zenith angles than possible via triggers from in-situ particle detectors and the method presented here can be easily adapted to neutrino experiments relying on RF-only detection. This paper discusses the system design, RFI characterization and mitigation techniques, and initial results from 10 cosmic ray candidate events identified within a 40-hour observing window. A design for a future optimized commensal cosmic-ray detector for the OVRO-LWA is presented, as well as recommendations for developing a similar capability for other experiments — these designs either reduce data-rate or increase sensitivity by an order of magnitude for many configurations of radio instruments.},

  abstract = {The cloud thermodynamic phase information derived from the CALIPSO lidar (CALIOP) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) channels of Aqua/MODIS represents different penetration depths within a cloud layer. This study combined them to better characterize the vertical stratification of the cloud thermodynamic phase within the atmospheric column. The temperature dependences of the phase occurrences were first compared between the two sensors to find a significant quantitative difference, which appeared to be large enough to affect climate model evaluations of the cloud phase representations. The two pieces of cloud phase information obtained from the two sensors, each binarized into liquid or ice, were then combined to define the four categories of cloud phases resulting from combinations of the two sensors that provide two cloud phases each (liquid and ice). Global occurrences of the four phase categories were validated against temperature information from MODIS thermal infrared (TIR) channels to confirm that the four categories are reasonably associated with cloud-top temperature and brightness temperature differences. The vertical stratification of the cloud thermodynamic phase characterized by CALIOP and SWIR was then investigated through comparisons with CloudSat/CPR radar profile statistics to illustrate how cloud vertical structures vary systematically with different combinations of the two cloud phases from CALIOP and SWIR. The results suggest that the combined use of complementary information from the four sensors (lidar, SWIR, TIR, and radar) can better characterize the vertical structures of the cloud thermodynamic phase, which could then provide more detailed observational constraints for model representations of the cloud phase.},

Though researchers first discovered these 150 km echoes over 50 years ago and use them to monitor vertical plasma drifts, the underlying mechanism that creates them remains a mystery. This paper uses large-scale kinetic simulations to show that photoelectrons can drive electron waves, which then enhance ion density irregularities that radars could observe as 150 km echoes. This model explains why 150 km echoes exist only during the day and why they appear at their lowest altitudes near noon. It predicts the spectral structure observed by Chau (2004) and suggests observations that can further evaluate this mechanism. It also shows the types and strength of electron modes that photoelectron-wave interactions generate in a magnetized plasma.},

  abstract = {Active cloud observations from A-Train’s CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites offer new opportunities to examine the vertical structure of hydrometeor layers. We use the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR merged CloudSat-CALIPSO product to examine global aspects of hydrometeor vertical stratification. We group the data into major cloud vertical structure (CVS) classes based on our interpretation of how clouds in three standard atmospheric layers overlap and provide their global frequency of occurrence. The two most frequent CVS classes are single-layer (per our definition) low and high clouds that represent \textasciitilde 53\% of cloudy skies, followed by high clouds overlying low clouds, and vertically extensive clouds that occupy near-contiguously a large portion of the troposphere. The prevalence of these configurations changes seasonally and geographically, between daytime and nighttime, and between continents and oceans. The radiative effects of the CVS classes reveal the major radiative warmers and coolers from the perspective of the planet as a whole, the surface, and the atmosphere. Single-layer low clouds dominate planetary and atmospheric cooling and thermal infrared surface warming. We also investigate the consistency between passive and active views of clouds by providing the CVS breakdowns of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud regimes for spatiotemporally coincident MODIS-Aqua (also on the A-Train) and CloudSat-CALIPSO daytime observations. When the analysis is expanded for a more in-depth look at the most heterogeneous of the MODIS cloud regimes, it ultimately confirms previous interpretations of their makeup that did not have the benefit of collocated active observations.},

The classical station beamformer used in SKA-low is resource efficient but cannot deal with the unknown sidelobe RFI. A real-time adaptive beamforming strategy is proposed for SKA-low station, which trades the capability of adaptive RFI nulling at an acceptably cost, it doesn’t require hardware redesign but only modifies the firmware accordingly. The proposed strategy uses a Parallel Least Mean Square (PLMS) algorithm, which has a computational complexity of 4N + 2 and can be performed in parallel. Beam pattern and output SINR simulation results show deeply nulling performance to sidelobe RFI, as well as good mainlobe response similar to the classical beamformer. The convergence performance depends on the signal-and-interference environments and step size, wherein too large a step size leads to a non-optimal output SINR and too small a step size leads to slow convergence speed. FPGA implementation demonstrations are implemented and tested on a NI FPGA module, and test results demonstrate good real-time performance and low slice resource consumption.},

At the Pierre Auger Observatory, the Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) has been measuring air-shower signals in conjunction with the particle detectors of the surface detector (SD) for over ten years. For an absolute determination of the CR energy with the Auger baseline detectors, the shower size estimator from the SD is calibrated with the energy scale of the fluorescence detector (FD). However, AERA has an independent access to the energy scale through the reconstructed radio signals. The hybrid detectors at the Pierre Auger Observatory offer the unique opportunity to compare the two independent energy scales. In this contribution, we present our envisaged methodology for cross-checking the agreement between the energy scales of the FD and AERA using hybrid SD-AERA shower data and simulations. We show individual steps of our radio signal reconstruction and highlight the key ingredients for calibrated energy measurements.},

  abstract = {Ground-based observations of Very High Energy (VHE) gamma rays from extreme astrophysical sources are significantly influenced by atmospheric conditions. This is due to the atmosphere being an integral part of the detector when utilizing Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Clouds and dust particles diminish atmospheric transmission of Cherenkov light, thereby impacting the reconstruction of the air showers and consequently the reconstructed gamma-ray spectra. Precise measurements of atmospheric transmission above Cherenkov observatories play a pivotal role in the accuracy of the analysed data, among which the corrections of the reconstructed energies and fluxes of incoming gamma rays, and in establishing observation strategies for different types of gamma-ray emitting sources. The Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes and the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), both located on the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos (ORM), La Palma, Canary Islands, use different sets of auxiliary instruments for real-time characterisation of the atmosphere. In this paper, historical data taken by MAGIC LIDAR (LIght Detection And Ranging) and CTAO FRAM (F/Photometric Robotic Telescope) are presented. From the atmospheric aerosol transmission profiles measured by the MAGIC LIDAR and CTAO FRAM aerosol optical depth maps, we obtain the characterisation of the clouds above the ORM at La Palma needed for data correction and optimal observation scheduling.},

Mathematical expressions are derived for the time fraction during which a given point in the sky is either clear or cloudy (including information on what portion of the cloud is visible), and the relationship is developed between cloud amount and average cloud separation distance. A calibration of the model for cumulus clouds is discussed. Although applicable to many disciplines, it is anticipated that the proposed model will be of most importance to solar energy engineering.

  abstract = {The Earth’s global atmospheric electric circuit depends on the upper and lower atmospheric boundaries formed by the ionosphere and the planetary surface. Thunderstorms and electrified rain clouds drive a DC current (∼1 kA) around the circuit, with the current carried by molecular cluster ions; lightning phenomena drive the AC global circuit. The Earth’s near-surface conductivity ranges from 10−7 S m−1 (for poorly conducting rocks) to 10−2 S m−1 (for clay or wet limestone), with a mean value of 3.2 S m−1 for the ocean. Air conductivity inside a thundercloud, and in fair weather regions, depends on location (especially geomagnetic latitude), aerosol pollution and height, and varies from ∼10−14 S m−1 just above the surface to 10−7 S m−1 in the ionosphere at ∼80 km altitude. Ionospheric conductivity is a tensor quantity due to the geomagnetic field, and is determined by parameters such as electron density and electron–neutral particle collision frequency. In the current source regions, point discharge (coronal) currents play an important role below electrified clouds; the solar wind-magnetosphere dynamo and the unipolar dynamo due to the terrestrial rotating dipole moment also apply atmospheric potential differences.},

  abstract = {Radio astronomical observations are increasingly contaminated by RF interference. Assuming an array of telescopes, a previous technique considered spatial filtering based on projecting out the interferer array signature vector. A disadvantage is that this effectively reduces the array by one (expensive) telescope. In this paper, we consider extending the astronomical array with a reference antenna array, and develop spatial filtering algorithms for this situation. The information from the reference antennas improves the quality of the interferer signature vector estimation, hence more of the interference can be projected out. Moreover, since only the covariance data of the astronomical array has to be reconstructed, the conditioning of the problem improves as well. The algorithms are tested both on simulated and experimental data.},

  abstract = {The first flight of the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment recorded 16 radio signals that were emitted by cosmic-ray induced air showers. The dominant contribution to the radiation comes from the deflection of positrons and electrons in the geomagnetic field, which is beamed in the direction of motion of the air shower. For 14 of these events, this radiation is reflected from the ice and subsequently detected by the ANITA experiment at a flight altitude of ∼36 km. In this paper, we estimate the energy of the 14 individual events and find that the mean energy of the cosmic-ray sample is 2.9 × 1018 eV, which is significantly lower than the previous estimate. By simulating the ANITA flight, we calculate its exposure for ultra-high energy cosmic rays. We estimate for the first time the cosmic-ray flux derived only from radio observations and find agreement with measurements performed at other observatories. In addition, we find that the ANITA data set is consistent with Monte-Carlo simulations for the total number of observed events and with the properties of those events.},

  abstract = {In the last fifteen years radio detection made it back to the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers, firstly, due to the installation and successful operation of digital radio experiments and, secondly, due to the quantitative understanding of the radio emission from atmospheric particle cascades. The radio technique has an energy threshold of about 100 PeV, which coincides with the energy at which a transition from the highest-energy galactic sources to the even more energetic extragalactic cosmic rays is assumed. Thus, radio detectors are particularly useful to study the highest-energy galactic particles and ultra-high-energy extragalactic particles of all types. Recent measurements by various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA, LOFAR, Tunka-Rex, and others have shown that radio measurements can compete in precision with other established techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the energy, and the position of the shower maximum, which is one of the best estimators for the composition of the primary cosmic rays. The scientific potential of the radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors, because this combination of complementary detectors can significantly increase the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This increase in accuracy is crucial for a better separation of different primary particles, like gamma-ray photons, neutrinos, or different types of nuclei, because showers initiated by these particles differ in average depth of the shower maximum and in the ratio between the amplitude of the radio signal and the number of muons. In addition to air-shower measurements, the radio technique can be used to measure particle cascades in dense media, which is a promising technique for detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Several pioneering experiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for the radio emission by neutrino-induced particle cascades in ice. In the next years these two sub-fields of radio detection of cascades in air and in dense media will likely merge, because several future projects aim at the simultaneous detection of both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search for neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and simultaneously provide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Moreover, detectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD or EVA are being considered to study the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. This review provides an introduction to the physics of radio emission by particle cascades, an overview on the various experiments and their instrumental properties, and a summary of methods for reconstructing the most important air-shower properties from radio measurements. Finally, potential applications of the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed.},

  abstract = {Radio measurements yield calorimetric information on the electromagnetic shower component around the clock. However, until recently it was not clear whether radio measurements can compete in accuracy with established nighttime techniques like air-Cherenkov or air-fluorescence detection. Due to recent progress in the radio technique as well as in the understanding of the emission mechanisms, the performance of current radio experiments has significantly improved. Above 100 PeV, digital, state-of-the-art antenna arrays achieve a reconstruction accuracy for the energy similar to that of other techniques, and can provide an independent measurement of the absolute energy scale. Furthermore, radio measurements are sensitive to the mass composition of the primary particles: First, the position of the shower maximum can be reconstructed from the radio signal. Second, in combination with muon detectors the measurement of the electromagnetic component provides complementary information on the primary mass. Since the radio footprint is huge for inclined showers, and the radio signal does not suffer absorption in the atmosphere, future radio arrays either focus on inclined showers at the highest energy, or on ultra-high precision measurements with extremely dense arrays. This proceeding reviews the current status of radio experiments and simulations as well as future plans.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Ions are formed in the terrestrial atmosphere (TA) and in interstellar clouds (ISC) by the action of solar/stellar UV and cosmic rays on the ambient neutral atmospheres. The precursor ions so formed develop largely via gas‐phase ion chemistry from the simple ions characteristic of the ambient atmospheres to the observed, more complex ions. In the upper TA and in ISC, only bimolecular ion chemistry occurs. In the tenuous upper TA, the ion types remain simple, O               +               , O                              , and NO               +               being dominant, and similarly in the tenuous diffuse ISC, ions such as H               +               , H2               2               +               , C               +               , and CH               +               are dominant. At the high pressures of the lower TA, termolecular association reactions are important, and the initial ions, e.g., O                              and N                              formed by cosmic ray ionization are quickly converted to very complex cluster ions of the type H               +               (H               2               O)               n               (bases)               m               with bases including NH               3               and CH               3               CN, and a parallel negative ion chemistry develops from the primary negative ions O               −               and O                              producing ions like NO                              (H               2               O)               n               (acid)               m               with acids HNO               3               and H               2               SO               4               . In the dense ISC, the ion chemistry proceeds to produce polyatomic ions from the most important initial ions C               +               , H                              , and CH                              , and the process of radiative association, the bimolecular analog of termolecular association, is important in producing, for example, ions such as CH                              M, where M are the common observed interstellar molecules such as the carboxy, cyano, and amino molecules, which are formed via this ion chemistry. The major ion neutralization process in the upper TA and in ISC is positive ion–electron recombination, which limits the degree of ionization in these regions, whereas in the lower TA, where negative ions balance the positive ions, the charge neutralization process is ion–ion recombinarion. © 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

This detection mechanism provides a measurement of the tau flux of cosmic neutrinos. We have installed an 8-channel prototype instrument at high elevation at Barcroft Field Station, which has been running since 2018, and consists of 4 dual-polarized antennas sensitive between 30-80 MHz, whose signals are filtered, amplified, digitized, and saved to disk using a custom data acquisition system (DAQ). The BEACON prototype is at high elevation to maximize effective volume and uses a directional beamforming trigger to improve rejection of anthropogenic background noise at the trigger level. Here we discuss the design, construction, and calibration of the BEACON prototype instrument. We also discuss the radio frequency environment observed by the instrument, and categorize the types of events seen by the instrument, including a likely cosmic ray candidate event.},

As part of this effort, cloud data from the CALIPSO lidar and the CloudSat radar are merged with the integrated column cloud properties from the CERES-MODIS analyses. The active and passive datasets are compared to determine commonalities and differences in order to facilitate the development of a 3dimensional cloud and aerosol dataset that will then be integrated into the CERES broadband radiance footprint. Preliminary results from the comparisons for April 2007 reveal that the CERES-MODIS global cloud amounts are, on average, 0.14 less and 0.15 greater than those from CALIPSO and CloudSat, respectively. These new data will provide unprecedented ability to test and improve global cloud and aerosol models, to investigate aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcing, and to validate the accuracy of global aerosol, cloud, and radiation data sets especially in polar regions and for multi-layered cloud conditions.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the γ-ray sky has improved dramatically in the past decade, however, the unresolved γ-ray background (UGRB) still has a potential wealth of information about the faintest γ-ray sources pervading the Universe. Statistical cross-correlations with tracers of cosmic structure can indirectly identify the populations that most characterize the γ-ray background. In this study, we analyze the angular correlation between the γ-ray background and the matter distribution in the Universe as traced by gravitational lensing, leveraging more than a decade of observations from the Fermi -Large Area Telescope (LAT) and 3 years of data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We detect a correlation at signal-tonoise ratio of 8.9. Most of the statistical significance comes from large scales, demonstrating, for the first time, that a substantial portion of the UGRB aligns with the mass clustering of the Universe as traced by weak lensing. Blazars provide a plausible explanation for this signal, especially if those contributing to the correlation reside in halos of large mass (∼ 1014M⊙) and account for approximately 30-40\% of the UGRB above 10 GeV. Additionally, we observe a preference for a curved γ-ray energy spectrum, with a log-parabolic shape being favored over a power-law. We also discuss the possibility of modifications to the blazar model and the inclusion of additional γ-ray sources, such as star-forming galaxies, misalinged active galactic nuclei, or particle dark matter.},

  abstract = {Cloud feedbacks continue to alter with climate change, which remains the largest source of uncertainty in global climate. Raindrop size distribution (DSD) is a fundamental characteristic of cloud microphysical and dynamical processes. This study characterizes the DSD and its response to cloud microphysical properties during the Indian Summer Monsoon season (June-October 2013–2015). The derived rain rate varied from 0.50 to 395.4 mm/h, which was segregated into stratiform rain (mean and standard deviation of 2.12 ± 1.24 mm/h) and convective rain (13.10 ± 14.45 mm/h). We found that as the convective DSD mode diameter gradually shifts to a larger drop size with increasing rain rate, the number concentration of small-sized rain drops decreased by about three orders of magnitude. While the mass-weighted mean diameter and normalized DSD scaling parameter were significantly higher for convective rain than stratiform rain, the normalized DSD scaling parameter was lowest for both convective and stratiform rain compared to previous studies over this region. The stratiform DSD was more skewed towards large raindrop size at a high cloud effective radius compared to a low cloud effective radius. However, the opposite response of the DSD for convective rain suggests the predominance of small-sized cloud/ice hydrometeors. This finding was further corroborated by the presence of narrower DSD at high cloud droplet number concentration compared to a low cloud droplet number concentration for the convective rain. The low wind shear and high convective available potential energy for convective rain further substantiated the persistent convective cores during monsoon accompanied by the formation of large size raindrops in the convective systems. Such a distinct response of DSD to different rain regimes could help in the short-term prediction of extreme rainfall events.},

This method can be regarded as a tomography of thunderclouds using cosmic rays as probes. The data cover the period from December 2011 till August 2014. We have developed an improved fitting procedure to be able to analyze the data. Our measurements show evidence for the main negative-charge layer near the −10◦ isotherm. This we have seen for a winter as well as for a summer cloud where multiple events pass through the same cloud and also the vertical component of the electric field could be reconstructed. On the day of measurement of some cosmic-ray events showing evidence for strong fields, no lightning activity was detected within 100 km distance. For the winter events, the top heights were between 5 and 6 km, while in the summer, typical top heights of 9 km were seen. Large horizontal components in excess of 70 kV/m of the electric fields are observed in the middle and top layers.},

The direct ionization by primary cosmic rays is explicitly taken into account. The model is applicable to the entire atmosphere, from the ground up to the stratosphere. A comparison to fragmentary direct measurements of the ionization in the atmosphere confirms the validity of the model in the whole range of geographical latitudes and altitudes. Results of the full Monte Carlo simulation are tabulated in a form of the ionization yield function. These tables are given together with a detailed recipe, which allows a user to compute easily the cosmic ray induced ionization for given location, altitude and the spectrum of cosmic rays. This provides a new tool for a quantitative study of the space weather influence upon the Earth's environment. Some practical applications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Tenuous plasmas in the earth’s atmosphere from sea level to 100 km can be modeled as a cold collisional plasma. If an ionization process results in an electron density profile, such as an Epstein profile, that decreases from a maximum as a function of distance, then the plasma can either reflect or absorb electromagnetic waves, depending on the plasma characteristics. A high reflection coefficient requires a grazing angle of incidence, a low momentum-transfer collision rate, a high plasma density, and a short free-space-to-plasma transition relative to a wavelength. High absorption from VHF through X-band requires a high collision rate, a low plasma density, and a plasma transition of approximately one wavelength. Both extremes a r e discussed. Typical collision rates and plasma lifetimes at atmospheric pressure are quantified. The power required to sustain a plasma in air is high because of a short plasma lifetime, but a noble gas contained within a membrane has a longer plasma lifetime and a lower power requirement. Two means of ionization are discussed: high-energy electronbeam impact and U V photoionization of an organic vapor.},

However, in this work, we consider the perspective of the SKA as a facility for studying physics. We review four areas in which the SKA is expected to make major contributions to our understanding of fundamental physics: cosmic dawn and reionisation; gravity and gravitational radiation; cosmology and dark energy; and dark matter and astroparticle physics. These discussions demonstrate that the SKA will be a spectacular physics machine, which will provide many new breakthroughs and novel insights on matter, energy and spacetime.},

The simulation was conducted using the charge of the thundercloud as the source, by incorporating a more up-to-date conductivity profile, and using the ion chemistry model for the lower ionosphere. The results revealed that a thundercloud charge of 30–100 C can cause a disturbance in the electron density in the lower ionosphere, decreasing to 40\% of the original value or increasing to 160\% of the original value. The electron density disturbance occurs mainly below an altitude of 80 km, and its peak is located at an altitude of 70 km, with a regional horizontal radius of about 50–75 km. The simulation results of this study improve the theory of Salem et al and extend the original one-dimensional model to three-dimensional space.},

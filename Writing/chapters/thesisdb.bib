	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04971},
	abstract = {Radio-based detection of high-energy particles is growing in maturity. In this chapter, we focus on the detection of neutrinos with energies in excess of 10 PeV that interact in the thick, radio-transparent ice found in the polar regions. High-energy neutrinos interacting in the ice generate short duration, radio-frequency ﬂashes through the Askaryan eﬀect that can be measured with antennas installed at shallow depths. The abundant target material and the long attenuation lengths of around 1 km allow cost-eﬀective instrumentation of huge volumes with a sparse array of radio detector stations. This detector architecture provides suﬃcient sensitivity to the low ﬂux of ultra-high-energy neutrinos to probe the production of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays whose origin is one of the longest-standing riddles in astroparticle physics. We describe the signal characteristics, propagation eﬀects, detector setup, suitable detection sites, and background processes. We give an overview of the current experimental landscape and an outlook into the future where almost the entire sky can be viewed by a judicious choice of detector locations.},

	abstract = {A successful ground array Radio Frequency (RF)-only self-trigger is demonstrated with 256 dual-polarization antennas of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory Long Wavelength Array (OVRO-LWA), yielding 10 highenergy cosmic ray candidates. This RF-only capability is predicated on novel techniques for Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) identification and mitigation with an analysis efficiency of approximately 45\% for showerdriven events with a Signal-to-noise ratio ≳ 5 against the galactic background noise power of individual antennas. Radio self-triggering enables more efficient detection of cosmic rays over a wider range of zenith angles than possible via triggers from in-situ particle detectors and the method presented here can be easily adapted to neutrino experiments relying on RF-only detection. This paper discusses the system design, RFI characterization and mitigation techniques, and initial results from 10 cosmic ray candidate events identified within a 40-hour observing window. A design for a future optimized commensal cosmic-ray detector for the OVRO-LWA is presented, as well as recommendations for developing a similar capability for other experiments — these designs either reduce data-rate or increase sensitivity by an order of magnitude for many configurations of radio instruments.},

Though researchers ﬁrst discovered these 150 km echoes over 50 years ago and use them to monitor vertical plasma drifts, the underlying mechanism that creates them remains a mystery. This paper uses large-scale kinetic simulations to show that photoelectrons can drive electron waves, which then enhance ion density irregularities that radars could observe as 150 km echoes. This model explains why 150 km echoes exist only during the day and why they appear at their lowest altitudes near noon. It predicts the spectral structure observed by Chau (2004) and suggests observations that can further evaluate this mechanism. It also shows the types and strength of electron modes that photoelectron-wave interactions generate in a magnetized plasma.},

Wideband log periodic antenna operating from 800MHz to 6GHz with 10 dipoles is designed, simulated on HFSS software and is realized on 1.6 mm Epoxy FR4 substrate. Designed antenna has advantages like wide bandwidth, simple design and the measured results are persistent with theoretical results. Antenna results indicate reflection coefficient below -10dB for whole band from 800MHz to 6GHz. The overall gain obtained is 4dB. This paper discusses complete idea about the LPDA and its design equations. Several parameters of antenna are evaluated and such antennas are used for applications like field strength meter.},

We compare our results with those of a full Monte Carlo simulation based on the ZHAireS code. This approach is able to reproduce the vector potential and hence electric field at any experimentally relevant observer position in the time domain. This work extends published results only valid for electron-induced showers. We establish the validity of the semi-analytical calculation of the radio signal produced by all types of neutrino-induced showers in ice. The method is computationally efficient and only requires as inputs the longitudinal charge excess profile of the showers and a parameterization of the vector potential in the far-field region of the shower at the Cherenkov angle that we also provide. Our methodology avoids tracking the contributions to the electric field from millions of particles every time the radio pulse has to be calculated at a given observer position. These results can be readily used in the interpretation of the data taken by experiments, and in the planning and design of future initiatives based on the radio technique in ice.},

If an ionization process results in an electron density profile, such as an Epstein profile, that decreases from a maximum as a function of distance, then the plasma can either reflect or absorb electromagnetic waves, depending on the plasma characteristics. A high reflection coefficient requires a grazing angle of incidence, a low momentum-transfer collision rate, a high plasma density, and a short free-space-to-plasma transition relative to a wavelength. High absorption from VHF through X-band requires a high collision rate, a low plasma density, and a plasma transition of approximately one wavelength. Both extremes a r e discussed. Typical collision rates and plasma lifetimes at atmospheric pressure are quantified. The power required to sustain a plasma in air is high because of a short plasma lifetime, but a noble gas contained within a membrane has a longer plasma lifetime and a lower power requirement. Two means of ionization are discussed: high-energy electronbeam impact and U V photoionization of an organic vapor.},

The classical station beamformer used in SKA-low is resource efficient but cannot deal with the unknown sidelobe RFI. A real-time adaptive beamforming strategy is proposed for SKA-low station, which trades the capability of adaptive RFI nulling at an acceptably cost, it doesn’t require hardware redesign but only modifies the firmware accordingly. The proposed strategy uses a Parallel Least Mean Square (PLMS) algorithm, which has a computational complexity of 4N + 2 and can be performed in parallel. Beam pattern and output SINR simulation results show deeply nulling performance to sidelobe RFI, as well as good mainlobe response similar to the classical beamformer. The convergence performance depends on the signal-and-interference environments and step size, wherein too large a step size leads to a non-optimal output SINR and too small a step size leads to slow convergence speed. FPGA implementation demonstrations are implemented and tested on a NI FPGA module, and test results demonstrate good real-time performance and low slice resource consumption.},

The information from the reference antennas improves the quality of the interferer signature vector estimation, hence more of the interference can be projected out. Moreover, since only the covariance data of the astronomical array has to be reconstructed, the conditioning of the problem improves as well.

	abstract = {Radio astronomy observational facilities are under constant upgradation and development to achieve better capabilities including increasing the time and frequency resolutions of the recorded data, and increasing the receiving and recording bandwidth. As only a limited spectrum resource has been allocated to radio astronomy by the International Telecommunication Union, this results in the radio observational instrumentation being inevitably exposed to undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI) signals which originate mainly from terrestrial human activity and are becoming stronger with time. RFIs degrade the quality of astronomical data and even lead to data loss. The impact of RFIs on scientiﬁc outcome is becoming progressively diﬃcult to manage. In this article, we motivate the requirement for RFI mitigation, and review the RFI characteristics, mitigation techniques and strategies. Mitigation strategies adopted at some representative observatories, telescopes and arrays are also introduced. We also discuss and present advantages and shortcomings of the four classes of RFI mitigation strategies, applicable at the connected causal stages: preventive, pre-detection, pre-correlation and post-correlation. The proper identiﬁcation and ﬂagging of RFI is key to the reduction of data loss and improvement in data quality, and is also the ultimate goal of developing RFI mitigation techniques. This can be achieved through a strategy involving a combination of the discussed techniques in stages. Recent advances in high speed digital signal processing and high performance computing allow for performing RFI excision of large data volumes generated from large telescopes or arrays in both real time and oﬄine modes, aiding the proposed strategy.},

	abstract = {In the last ﬁfteen years radio detection made it back to the list of promising techniques for extensive air showers, ﬁrstly, due to the installation and successful operation of digital radio experiments and, secondly, due to the quantitative understanding of the radio emission from atmospheric particle cascades. The radio technique has an energy threshold of about 100 PeV, which coincides with the energy at which a transition from the highest-energy galactic sources to the even more energetic extragalactic cosmic rays is assumed. Thus, radio detectors are particularly useful to study the highest-energy galactic particles and ultra-high-energy extragalactic particles of all types. Recent measurements by various antenna arrays like LOPES, CODALEMA, AERA, LOFAR, Tunka-Rex, and others have shown that radio measurements can compete in precision with other established techniques, in particular for the arrival direction, the energy, and the position of the shower maximum, which is one of the best estimators for the composition of the primary cosmic rays. The scientiﬁc potential of the radio technique seems to be maximum in combination with particle detectors, because this combination of complementary detectors can signiﬁcantly increase the total accuracy for air-shower measurements. This increase in accuracy is crucial for a better separation of diﬀerent primary particles, like gamma-ray photons, neutrinos, or diﬀerent types of nuclei, because showers initiated by these particles diﬀer in average depth of the shower maximum and in the ratio between the amplitude of the radio signal and the number of muons. In addition to air-shower measurements, the radio technique can be used to measure particle cascades in dense media, which is a promising technique for detection of ultra-high-energy neutrinos. Several pioneering experiments like ARA, ARIANNA, and ANITA are currently searching for the radio emission by neutrino-induced particle cascades in ice. In the next years these two sub-ﬁelds of radio detection of cascades in air and in dense media will likely merge, because several future projects aim at the simultaneous detection of both, high-energy cosmic-rays and neutrinos. SKA will search for neutrino and cosmic-ray initiated cascades in the lunar regolith and simultaneously provide unprecedented detail for air-shower measurements. Moreover, detectors with huge exposure like GRAND, SWORD or EVA are being considered to study the highest energy cosmic rays and neutrinos. This review provides an introduction to the physics of radio emission by particle cascades, an overview on the various experiments and their instrumental properties, and a summary of methods for reconstructing the most important air-shower properties from radio measurements. Finally, potential applications of the radio technique in high-energy astroparticle physics are discussed.},

	abstract = {This article presents the GCM‐Oriented Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud Product (GOCCP) designed to evaluate the cloudiness simulated by general circulation models (GCMs). For this purpose, Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization L1 data are processed following the same steps as in a lidar simulator used to diagnose the model cloud cover that CALIPSO would observe from space if the satellite was flying above an atmosphere similar to that predicted by the GCM. Instantaneous profiles of the lidar scattering ratio (SR) are first computed at the highest horizontal resolution of the data but at the vertical resolution typical of current GCMs, and then cloud diagnostics are inferred from these profiles: vertical distribution of cloud fraction, horizontal distribution of low, middle, high, and total cloud fractions, instantaneous SR profiles, and SR histograms as a function of height. Results are presented for different seasons (January–March 2007–2008 and June–August 2006–2008), and their sensitivity to parameters of the lidar simulator is investigated. It is shown that the choice of the vertical resolution and of the SR threshold value used for cloud detection can modify the cloud fraction by up to 0.20, particularly in the shallow cumulus regions. The tropical marine low‐level cloud fraction is larger during nighttime (by up to 0.15) than during daytime. The histograms of SR characterize the cloud types encountered in different regions. The GOCCP high‐level cloud amount is similar to that from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) and the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). The low‐level and middle‐level cloud fractions are larger than those derived from passive remote sensing (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project, Moderate‐Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer–Cloud and Earth Radiant Energy System Polarization and Directionality of Earth Reflectances, TOVS Path B, AIRS–Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique) because the latter only provide information on the uppermost cloud layer.},

We use the 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR merged CloudSat-CALIPSO product to examine global aspects of hydrometeor vertical stratiﬁcation. We group the data into major cloud vertical structure (CVS) classes based on our interpretation of how clouds in three standard atmospheric layers overlap and provide their global frequency of occurrence. The two most frequent CVS classes are single-layer (per our deﬁnition) low and high clouds that represent {\textasciitilde}53\% of cloudy skies, followed by high clouds overlying low clouds, and vertically extensive clouds that occupy near-contiguously a large portion of the troposphere. The prevalence of these conﬁgurations changes seasonally and geographically, between daytime and nighttime, and between continents and oceans. The radiative effects of the CVS classes reveal the major radiative warmers and coolers from the perspective of the planet as a whole, the surface, and the atmosphere. Single-layer low clouds dominate planetary and atmospheric cooling and thermal infrared surface warming. We also investigate the consistency between passive and active views of clouds by providing the CVS breakdowns of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer cloud regimes for spatiotemporally coincident MODIS-Aqua (also on the A-Train) and CloudSat-CALIPSO daytime observations. When the analysis is expanded for a more in-depth look at the most heterogeneous of the MODIS cloud regimes, it ultimately conﬁrms previous interpretations of their makeup that did not have the beneﬁt of collocated active observations.},

Simulation results show signiﬁcant turbulence eﬀects above sea in daytime, under stable conditions, which are attributed to the presence of atmospheric ducts. Weak turbulence eﬀects are observed over lands in daytime, under unstable conditions, in which the high surface temperature prevents the formation of ducts.},

As part of this effort, cloud data from the CALIPSO lidar and the CloudSat radar are merged with the integrated column cloud properties from the CERES-MODIS analyses. The active and passive datasets are compared to determine commonalities and differences in order to facilitate the development of a 3dimensional cloud and aerosol dataset that will then be integrated into the CERES broadband radiance footprint. Preliminary results from the comparisons for April 2007 reveal that the CERES-MODIS global cloud amounts are, on average, 0.14 less and 0.15 greater than those from CALIPSO and CloudSat, respectively. These new data will provide unprecedented ability to test and improve global cloud and aerosol models, to investigate aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcing, and to validate the accuracy of global aerosol, cloud, and radiation data sets especially in polar regions and for multi-layered cloud conditions.},
